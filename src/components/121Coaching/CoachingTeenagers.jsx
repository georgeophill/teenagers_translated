            Parents usually approach us for coaching for their child so we start
            by discussing the areas that are worrying you, and tailor your
            childâ€™s sessions to target and improve the problems. Teenagers find
            the sessions relevant and helpful, and attend willingly. Feedback
            and outcomes are very good.

              Sessions are 60mins and normally, 4-6 appointments are needed to
              see changes. Often, teenagers wish to have additional sessions,
              but this is not necessary. Please contact us to arrange an initial
              30 min zoom call (free of charge) to discuss your requirements.
