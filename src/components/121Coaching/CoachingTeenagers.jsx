            Individual coaching sessions for teenagers focus overall on helping
            teens to develop the knowledge and practical skills to help boost
            their mental health, regulate their emotions without acute
            oscillations, manage anxiety and daily stresses (eg exams, friends,
            social media) and develop a more positive mindset. We start by
            discussing the areas that are worrying you, and tailor your childâ€™s
            sessions to target and improve the problems. Teenagers usually find
            the sessions relevant and helpful, and attend willingly. Feedback
            and outcomes are very good.

              Sessions are 60mins and take place on zoom. Normally, 4-6
              appointments are needed to see changes. Please contact us to
              arrange an initial 30 min zoom call (free of charge) to discuss
              your requirements.
