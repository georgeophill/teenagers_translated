              Janey Downshire and Naella Grew are co-founders of Teenagers
              Translated. Their bespoke training programmes comprise parent
              talks and courses, as well as student workshops to dovetail with a
              schoolâ€™s existing PSHE provision, and staff inset training to
              support student wellbeing and mental health. They have been
              regularly in the press and spoken at conferences including the
              Boarding & State boarding Schools Association. They were the
              National Citizens Service spokespeople for a campaign aimed at
              helping parents better manage teen stress. <br />
              <br />
