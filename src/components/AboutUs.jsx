              courses and workshops have been delivered to thousands of parents
              around the UK and overseas, in schools and communities. Alongside
              these, they have developed and conducted student workshops to
              dovetail with a schoolâ€™s existing PSHE provision, and designed to
              enhance good mental health and wellbeing. Their staff inset
              training further supports student learning, awareness and positive
              mental health and wellbeing. They have taught in over 50 schools
              in the UK & overseas during the last 14 years. <br />
              <br />
              Over this period, they have been regularly in the press and spoken
              at conferences including the Boarding Schools Association and the
              State Boarding School Association. They were also the National
              Citizens Service spokespeople for a media campaign aimed at
              helping parents to better manage teenage stress. As members of
              BACP, they both undertake ongoing professional development
              training around healthy child development, wellbeing and mental
              health in schools.
